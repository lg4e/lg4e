# Chapter 1: Introduction to Logic

## 1.1 The Foundations of Logical Reasoning

Logic has many uses, as mention in the preface. 
This is the sort of thing that logicians are interested in. We
will say that an argument is any collection of premises, together
with a conclusion.
This Part discusses some basic logical notions that apply to
arguments in a natural language like English. It is important to
begin with a clear understanding of what arguments are and of
what it means for an argument to be valid. Later we will represent
English-language arguments in a formal language.
In the example just given, we used individual sentences to
express both of the argument’s premises, and we used a third
sentence to express the argument’s conclusion. Many arguments
are expressed in this way, but a single sentence can contain a
complete argument. Consider:
The butler has an alibi; so they cannot have done it.
This argument has one premise followed by a conclusion.
Many arguments start with premises, and end with a conclu-
sion, but not all of them. The argument with which this section
began might equally have been presented with the conclusion at
the beginning, like so:
The gardener did it. After all, it was either the butler
or the gardener. And the butler didn’t do it.
Equally, it might have been presented with the conclusion in the
middle:
The butler didn’t do it. Accordingly, it was the gar-
dener, given that it was either the gardener or the
butler.
When approaching an argument, we want to know whether or not
the conclusion follows from the premises. So the first thing to do
is to separate out the conclusion from the premises. As a guide,
these words are often used to indicate an argument’s conclusion:
so, therefore, hence, thus, accordingly, consequently
What we will befocussing on here is its use in evaluating arguments; sorting thegood from the bad.In everyday language, we sometimes use the word ‘argument’to talk about belligerent shouting matches. If you and a friendhave an argument in this sense, things are not going well betweenthe two of you. 

## 1.2 Principles of Deductive and Inductive Logic 

Logic is not concerned with such teeth-gnashingand hair-pulling. They are not arguments, in our sense; they arejust disagreements.An argument, as we will understand it, is something morelike this:Either the butler or the gardener did it.The butler didn’t do it.∴ The gardener did it.We have here a series of sentences. The three dots on the thirdline of the argument are read ‘therefore.’ They indicate that thefinal sentence expresses the conclusion of the argument. The twosentences before that are the premises of the argument. This is the sort of thing that logicians are interested in. We
will say that an argument is any collection of premises, together
with a conclusion.

## 1.3 Logical Fallacies: Identifying Errors in 
If you be-lieve the premises, and you think the conclusion follows from thepremises—that the argument, as we will say, is valid—then this(perhaps) provides you with a reason to believe the conclusion.
This is the sort of thing that logicians are interested in. We
will say that an argument is any collection of premises, together
